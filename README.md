# PokéClash & Catch: A Discord Pokémon Adventure

## Project Overview

PokéClash & Catch is a feature-rich Discord bot that brings the full Pokémon experience directly to your server. It transforms the Discord environment into a vibrant world where players can embark on their own Pokémon journey, all through intuitive and engaging text commands. The bot is designed to be a comprehensive and immersive adventure for both new and veteran Pokémon fans.

## Core Features

- **Wild Pokémon Encounters**: Players can encounter and capture Pokémon from all 9 generations, including rare and elusive Shiny, Mythical, Legendary, Paradox, and Ultra Beast species.
- **Engaging 1v1 Battles**: Challenge powerful NPCs with tiered difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite, Master) or test your skills in duels against other players in the server.
- **Pokémon Evolution**: Evolve your Pokémon by leveling them up or by using specific evolution stones, adding a strategic layer to your collection.
- **Player Progression**: Track your journey with a detailed trainer profile, complete with levels, battle records, and a comprehensive inventory.
- **In-Game Economy**: Earn "Remnants" through daily rewards and battles. Use them to purchase various types of Pokéballs (including Master, Beast, Dusk, Fast, Heal, and Luxury Balls) and evolution stones from the shop.
- **Customization and Strategy**: Define a specific Pokémon from your collection as your active companion for battles, allowing for personalized strategies.
- **Server Rankings**: A competitive ranking system lets players see who the top trainers are, based on captures, battle wins, or trainer level.

## Why PokéClash & Catch?

PokéClash & Catch was born from a passion for the Pokémon franchise. Our goal is to recreate the joy of the Pokémon adventure in a fun, accessible, and community-driven way. We believe in the values of **persistence, evolution, and community**, and these principles are at the heart of our bot's design. We are constantly improving and evolving to provide the best possible experience for our players.
